Practical No. 2

Problem Statement ---

Write a Python programto store marks scored in subject “fundamental of Data structure” by
N students in the class.
Write functions to compute following:
a) The average score of class


Solution ---

def get_marks():
    marks = []
    n = int(input("Enter the number of students: "))
    for i in range(n):
        mark = int(input(f"Enter the marks for student {i + 1}: "))
        marks.append(mark)
    return marks

def average_score(marks):
    if len(marks) == 0:
        return 0
    return sum(marks) / len(marks)

def main():
    marks = get_marks()
    avg_score = average_score(marks)
    print(f"\nAverage score of the class: {avg_score:.2f}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
