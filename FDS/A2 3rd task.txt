Practical No.2

Task 3 - Write a Python programto store marks scored in subject “fundamental of Data structure” by 
N students in the class.
Write functions to compute following:

Count of students who were absent for the test

Solution --
def count_absent_students(marks):
    count = 0
    for mark in marks:
        if mark is None:
            count += 1
    return count

# Input: Number of students
N = int(input("Enter the number of students: "))

# Input: Marks of each student (use 'None' for absent students)
marks = []
for i in range(N):
    mark = input(f"Enter marks for student {i+1} (or 'A' if absent): ")
    if mark.upper() == 'A':
        marks.append(None)
    else:
        marks.append(int(mark))

# Compute the count of absent students
absent_count = count_absent_students(marks)
print(f"Number of students who were absent for the test: {absent_count}")
