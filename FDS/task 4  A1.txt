Problem Statement----

In second year computer engineering class, group A studentâ€™s play cricket, group B students
play badminton and group C students play football.
Write a Python program using functions to compute following: -

Task -4 Number of students who play cricket and football but not badminton.

# Function to remove duplicates from a list
def remove_duplicates(lst):
    unique_list = []
    for item in lst:
        if item not in unique_list:
            unique_list.append(item)
    return unique_list

# Function to find intersection of two lists
def intersection(lst1, lst2):
    intersected_list = []
    for item in lst1:
        if item in lst2:
            intersected_list.append(item)
    return intersected_list

# Main function to solve the problem
def cricket_and_football_not_badminton(group_a, group_b, group_c):
    # Step 1: Remove duplicates
    group_a = remove_duplicates(group_a)
    group_b = remove_duplicates(group_b)
    group_c = remove_duplicates(group_c)
    
    # Step 2: Find students who play both cricket and football
    cricket_and_football = intersection(group_a, group_c)
    
    # Step 3: Filter out students who also play badminton
    final_list = []
    for student in cricket_and_football:
        if student not in group_b:
            final_list.append(student)
    
    # Step 4: Return the number of such students
    return len(final_list), final_list

# Example usage
group_a = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Bob"]      # Cricket players
group_b = ["Charlie", "Eve", "Frank"]                      # Badminton players
group_c = ["Alice", "David", "George", "Charlie"]          # Football players

count, students = cricket_and_football_not_badminton(group_a, group_b, group_c)

print(f"Number of students who play cricket and football but not badminton: {count}")
print("Students:", students)
