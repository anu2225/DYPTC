Problem Statement----

In second year computer engineering class, group A studentâ€™s play cricket, group B students
play badminton and group C students play football.
Write a Python program using functions to compute following: -
a) List of students who play both cricket and badminton
b) List of students who play either cricket or badminton but not both
c) Number of students who play neither cricket nor badminton
d) Number of students who play cricket and football but not badminton.
(Note- While realizing the group, duplicate entries should be avoided, Do not use SET builtin functions)


Solution ----

# Function to remove duplicates from a list
def remove_duplicates(lst):
    unique_lst = []
    for item in lst:
        if item not in unique_lst:
            unique_lst.append(item)
    return unique_lst

# Function to find intersection of two lists
def intersection(lst1, lst2):
    inter = []
    for item in lst1:
        if item in lst2 and item not in inter:
            inter.append(item)
    return inter

# Function to find students who play both cricket and badminton
def cricket_and_badminton(cricket, badminton):
    return intersection(cricket, badminton)

# Example data
cricket = remove_duplicates(['Alice', 'Charlie', 'Eva', 'Grace', 'Bob'])
badminton = remove_duplicates(['Bob', 'Charlie', 'David', 'Helen'])

# a) List of students who play both cricket and badminton
students_playing_both = cricket_and_badminton(cricket, badminton)
print("Students who play both cricket and badminton:", students_playing_both)
