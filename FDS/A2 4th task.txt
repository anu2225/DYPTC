Task 4 --- 

Write a Python programto store marks scored in subject “fundamental of Data structure” by 
N students in the class.
Write functions to compute following:

Display mark with highest frequency

Solution ----


from collections import Counter

def find_highest_frequency_mark(marks):
    # Using Counter to count the frequency of each mark
    frequency = Counter(marks)
    
    # Finding the mark with the highest frequency
    max_frequency = max(frequency.values())
    
    # Extracting all marks that have the highest frequency
    most_frequent_marks = [mark for mark, freq in frequency.items() if freq == max_frequency]
    
    # Return the marks with the highest frequency and the frequency
    return most_frequent_marks, max_frequency

# Input: Number of students
N = int(input("Enter the number of students: "))

# Input: Marks of each student
marks = []
for i in range(N):
    mark = int(input(f"Enter marks for student {i+1}: "))
    marks.append(mark)

# Find and display the mark(s) with the highest frequency
most_frequent_marks, max_frequency = find_highest_frequency_mark(marks)
print(f"Mark(s) with the highest frequency: {most_frequent_marks}")
print(f"Highest frequency: {max_frequency}")
